# Codeforces-Mimic-Task 

* We have made this Codeforces look-like backend project using Kafka as a message queue, Judge0 as a submission validation (which tells if the problem is accepted, time limit, wrong answer..),Web Socket to connect the user to the server in real-time communication, that if something new happened to the user submissions states, it directly send to the user.
